<div class="bodycontainer" style="text-align:left; line-height:1.8rem;">
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;"><img class="home-headshot" src="resources/headshot.jpg">Hello! I'm Yume (pronounced "you may"), an attorney based in San Francisco, California. I work for Sher Edling LLP, a boutique law firm that represents states, counties, cities, and other public entities across the United States in high-impact, public-interest climate change and environmental litigation.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I'm an all-rounder who leads small teams across all stages of trial litigation. I often work on complicated doctrinal issues in the areas of civil procedure, federal courts, remedies, statutory interpretation, structural constitutional law, and torts. I'm a prolific writer who's authored all manner of briefs.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I was born in Japan and grew up in San Diego, where I split my time between the classroom, track, and beach. I moved east to attend Yale College (2015), the Yale School of the Environment (2019), and Yale Law School (2019), where I was a member of the <i>Yale Law Journal</i> and a John Kerry Fellow. Then, I clerked for judges on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Hon. John A. Kronstadt) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (Hon. Scott M. Matheson, Jr.) before joining Sher Edling.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">In my spare time, I hike, I'm training for a triathlon, and I'm planning to re-learn how to surf after a long hiatus. I'm a news junkie who prizes and hoards interesting and occasionally useful information. In another life, I would have been an engineer: I'm fascinated by complicated machines, civil infrastructure, and technology in general.
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Please don't hesitate to get in touch at yume.hoshijima [at] aya.yale.edu or yume [at] sheredling.com.</h4>
