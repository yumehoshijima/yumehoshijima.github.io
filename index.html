    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;"><img class="home-headshot" src="resources/headshot.jpg">Hello! I'm Yume (pronounced "you may"), an attorney based in San Francisco, California. I work for Sher Edling LLP, where I represent states, counties, cities, and other public entities across the United States in high-impact, public-interest climate change and environmental litigation.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I'm an adaptable all-rounder who leads small teams across every phase of litigation. That said, I specialize in authoring and editing critical, complicated briefs. I enjoy solving difficult strategic problems relating to civil procedure, federal jurisdiction, remedies, statutory interpretation, structural constitutional law, and torts.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I was born in Japan and grew up in San Diego. I moved east to attend Yale College (2015), the Yale School of the Environment (2019), and Yale Law School (2019). Then, I clerked for the Honorable John A. Kronstadt of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (2019-20) and the Honorable Scott M. Matheson, Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2020-21) before joining Sher Edling.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">In my spare time, I hike, I'm training for a triathlon, and I'm planning to re-learn how to surf after a long hiatus. I'm a news junkie who prizes and hoards interesting and occasionally useful information. If not for my belief that today's grave environmental problems require legal solutions, I would have been an engineer: I have a strong STEM background and am fascinated by complicated machines, civil infrastructure, and technology in general.
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Please don't hesitate to get in touch at yume.hoshijima [at] aya.yale.edu or yume [at] sheredling.com.</h4>
