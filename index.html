    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;"><img class="home-headshot" src="resources/headshot.jpg">Hello! I'm Yume (pronounced "you may"), an attorney based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work for Sher Edling LLP, a boutique law firm that represents states, counties, cities, and other public entities across the United States in high-impact, public-interest climate change and environmental litigation. I'm an all-rounder who leads teams across all stages of litigation from pre-suit investigations to appeals, with an especially heavy emphasis on critical motions.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">I was born in Japan and grew up in San Diego, where I split my time between the classroom, track, and beach. I moved east to attend Yale College (2015), the Yale School of the Environment (2019), and Yale Law School (2019). Then, I clerked for a couple of years in Los Angeles (C.D. Cal.) and Salt Lake City (10th Cir.) before joining Sher Edling. In my spare time, I swim, cycle, hike, and am planning to re-learn how to surf after a long hiatus. I'm a news junkie who prizes and hoards interesting and occasionally useful information. Please use this website to learn about me, and please don't hesitate to get in touch at yume.hoshijima [at] aya.yale.edu</h4>
