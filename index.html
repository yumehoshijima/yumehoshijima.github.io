    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;"><img class="home-headshot" src="resources/headshot.jpg">Hello! I'm Yume (pronounced "you may"), an attorney based in San Francisco, California. I work for Sher Edling LLP, where I represent states, local governments, and other public entities across the United States in high-impact, public-interest climate change and environmental litigation.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">I was born in Japan and grew up in San Diego. I moved east to attend Yale College (B.A. 2015), the Yale School of the Environment (M.E.M. 2019), and Yale Law School (J.D. 2019), where I was an editor of the <i>Yale Law Journal</i>, a heavily involved clinical student, and an inaugural John Kerry Fellow. Then, I clerked for the Honorable John A. Kronstadt of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (2019&ndash;20) and the Honorable Scott M. Matheson, Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2020&ndash;21) before joining Sher Edling.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">In my spare time, I spend lots of time outdoors: I train for standard-distance triathlons, and I explore the Bay Area's numerous parks. I'm a news junkie who prizes and hoards interesting and occasionally useful information. If not for my belief that today's grave environmental problems require legal responses, I would have been an engineer: I'm fascinated by complicated machines, civil infrastructure, and technology in general.
    <h4 style="font-weight:normal;">Please don't hesitate to get in touch at yume.hoshijima [at] aya.yale.edu.</h4>
