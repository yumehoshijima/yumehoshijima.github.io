    <h3>Examples of My Legal Writing</h3>
    <p style="font-weight:700;"><i>Cal. Dep't of Toxic Substances Control v. NL Indus., Inc.</i>, No. 2:20-cv-11293-SVW-JPRx (C.D. Cal.). 
    </p>
    <p>I represent the State of California in this cost-recovery litigation arising out of the state's largest-ever contaminated site cleanup. In this fast-paced matter, I've authored the vast majority of motions, trial, and miscellaneous briefing since late summer 2022. For example, I was the primary author of the <a href="resources/2023-05-23%20DTSC%20Ph%20II%20Pre-Trial%20Brief.pdf">pre-trial</a> and <a href="resources/2023-07-01%20DTSC%20Ph%20II%20Post-Trial%20Brief.pdf">post-trial</a> briefs for the "Phase II" trial, as well as the <a href="resources/2023-07-25%20DTSC%20Ph%20III%20Pre-Trial%20Brief.pdf">pre-trial</a> and <a href="resources/2023-08-25%20DTSC%20Ph%20III%20Post-Trial%20Brief.pdf">post-trial</a> briefs for the "Phase III" trial. Both trials yielded mostly favorable verdicts for the State.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:700;"><i>Cal. River Watch v. City of Vacaville</i>, 14 F.4th 1076 (9th Cir. 2021), <i>withdrawn and superseded upon denial of reh'g en banc</i>, 39 F.4th 624 (9th Cir. 2022).</p>
    <p>The Ninth Circuit published a decision that would have exposed public water suppliers to citizens' suits under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act for the presence of contaminants in drinking water at concentrations below applicable maximum contaminant levels adopted under the Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state statutes. I wrote an <a href="resources/2021-11-15%20California%20River%20Watch%20Amicus.pdf"><i>amicus</i> brief</a> on behalf of the National League of Cities and League of California Cities in support of a petition for rehearing en banc. In response, the panel withdrew its decision and reversed itself.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:700;"><i>Cnty. of Maui v. Sunoco LP</i>, No. 2CCV-20-0000283 (Haw. 2d Cir. Ct.).</p>
    <p>I help represent the County of Maui in its pioneering climate-deception lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies for climate-related harm. The Defendants moved to dismiss. I and a colleague together wrote the County's <a href="resources/2022-06-24%20Maui%20MTD%20Opp.pdf">opposition brief</a>, which was the first-ever brief to defend the state-law merits of climate-deception claims. The motion remains under submission.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:700;"><i>Cnty. of San Mateo v. Monsanto Co.</i>, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, No. 4:22-cv-03257-JST, 2022 WL 19934417 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2022).</p>
    <p>San Mateo County and fourteen towns and cities in the county, acting both on their own behalf and on behalf of the People of the State of California, sued Monsanto for claims relating to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) impairment of San Francisco Bay. Monsanto removed the action to federal court, asserting there was complete diversity because the People were merely a nominal party. I was the sole author of the plaintiffs' <a href="resources/2022-08-11%20SMCO%20Motion.pdf">remand motion</a> and <a href="resources/2022-10-11%20SMCO%20Reply.pdf">reply brief</a>. The court granted the motion, returning the action to state court.</p>
